<h1>Dog and Cat?</h1>
<h2>What kind of person are you?</h2>
<p>The world is made up of three types of people: Cat people; dog people; and boring people.</p>

<h3>Dogs</h3>

<p>The dog's story is inexorably linked with the human's. Dogs are dogs, and not wolves, purely because of human
    tampering. They were made by us to fit us. The same is rue of almonds, but almonds don't play fetch. We took, and take,
    the cute ones, the sweet ones, the ones we like the best and mold them and thei offspring, ofien to the detriment of their
    health, into our perfect companions. And that they are.</p>
<h3>Cats</h3>

<p>Cats are graceful, clumsy, silky soft with sharp edges, softly glowing eyes in the dark, purring, kneading balls of fur
    curled up closely against your body warmih, ntellegent, annoying, funny, great conversationaliss with comments about
    many things, and intriguing lie creatures who display many emotions including affection, even love for their
    Gonrdions.</p>
